GalacticPlot
============

A set of python tools to plot in Equatorial or Galactic Coordinate systems following normal conventions.

To generate the random data, the coordinate-utils package is
needed from icecube software package.  So for now, I will 
generate that on grappa.  

galPlot is setup now for initial testing.  It needs to be
cleaned up quite a bit, especially since it is kind of 
broken at the moment.  

To execute:
1.) ipython -pylab
2.) from galPlot improt *
3.) plotTree() <---- This will be updated
